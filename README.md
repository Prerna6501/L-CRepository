Assignment Title: Inventory Management System with Exception Handling

Objective:
  Develop an inventory management system for a small business that handles various operations such as adding, updating, and deleting products from the inventory. The system should implement proper exception handling.

Requirements:
  1. Create a Product class with attributes such as id, name, price, and quantity.
  2. Implement a ProductManager class responsible for managing the inventory operations, including adding, updating, and deleting products.
    Handle exceptions such as:
      => Invalid input data (e.g., negative price or quantity)
      => Product not found during update or deletion
      => Insufficient quantity during product sale
      => DuplicateProductException
  3. Implement a user interface (console-based or GUI) to interact with the inventory management system.
  4. Use Custom Exception as much as you can do.
